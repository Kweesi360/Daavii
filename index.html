                since we have been together, 2 SOLID years and more since I saw that video of you<br><br/> and texted you. Two years ago around this time we made memories right from me seeing you walk out of the class at GETFUND.<br><br/> HMMMMM!! At this point, I just want to continue seeing you till my last breath😫❤️.

                Happyyyyy Anniversary babe. Today actually reminds me that this very day 2 years ago I decided to buy problems for myself…. Lmao just kidding 😂😂😂. That was actually the best decision I ever made in myself even though it was a lil tough and had to let you go through hard times as well .<br><br/> I ain’t using this day to remind you of the bad stuffs I made you go through but rather to celebrate you !!! If you had not done stuffs you didn’t believe you would ever do in your life I honestly don’t think this relationship would have ever existed you’re my favourite “DAAVI😂❤️” and I love you so much beautiful. With everything we both have gone through, we have the ability to face any obstacle life throws at us from today.!!<br><br/> You’re my peace and I always say I’m just soo comfortable speaking with you everytime. I can’t wait to see you sweedy , I can’t wait to settle down with you , I can’t wait to go Down on one knee to ask you out in front of the world😫😫, I can’t wait to officially call you mine , I can’t wait to hold your hands while we travel the world together, I can’t wait to be catching flights with you and lastly, I can’t wait to see you as the mother of my kids 🥹❤️😭. You’re the perfect person !!! I love you sweedy “<br/><br/>

Thank you for being the person you are and for sharing your beautiful soul with me. Cheers to celebrating the wonderful you on this special day and every day that follows. Happy Anniversary, my love! 🎈❤️🥳
